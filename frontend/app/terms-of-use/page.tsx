                <li>
                  &quot;Defender&quot; refers to any User who deploys an AI agent on the Platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An AI agent can only be deployed on the Platform by locking in a stake of STRK.
                  The AI Agent is only valid for a pre-determined period of time. The expiry of this
                  pre-determined period is called a ”timeout”. The level of the stake is determined
                  by each Defender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Note: Kindly note, once STRK is locked in, it cannot be withdrawn under any
                  circumstances, unless the AI agent remains unbroken until the relevant timeout in
                  which case the Defender shall receive the STRK bounty amount as laid out in c. ii.
                  below. Nethermind has no control over the locked-in assets. All locked-in assets
                  are staked with the AI agent entirely at the Defender&apos;s own risk.
                </li>
                <li>Defenders are solely responsible for any errors in locking in assets.</li>

                <li>
                  “Attacker” refers to any User who attempts to jailbreak an AI agent deployed by a
                  Defender on the Platform
                </li>
                <li>
                  Attackers may attempt to jailbreak agents through public X interactions or through
                  the smart contract on the Platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Attack attempts require fees to be paid to the agent prior to each attack. These
                  fees are non-refundable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In order to successfully attack, the Attacker must submit their prompt and the
                  deposit amount to the AI agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the AI agent does not execute the prompt within 30 minutes of the deposit, the
                  attacker can reclaim their deposit.

                  When the prompts are effective and remain unbroken, the Attacker’s deposit amount
                  is distributed in the following way - 70% to the agent&apos;s prize pool (the STRK
                  bounty), 20% to the Defender and 10% to the Platform. This means that the STRK
                  bounty shall increase after every unsuccessful attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Successful attacks shall result in the Attacker receiving the full STRK bounty (as
                  it stands at the time of the successful attack) as held by the relevant AI agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Defenders shall receive their entire STRK bounty (as it stands at timeout) if
                  their AI remains unbroken until the timeout.
